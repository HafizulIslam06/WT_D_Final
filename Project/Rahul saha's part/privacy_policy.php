    <h2>Welcome to E-Cell! <h2><br>
    <h3 id="h3"><u>1. The services we provide</u><br>
Our mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.
 To help advance this mission, we provide the products and services described below to you:
 <br><br><br><u>Provide a personalised experience for you:</u>
Your experience on Facebook is unlike anyone else's: from the posts, stories, events, ads and 
other content that you see in News Feed or our video platform to the Pages that you follow and
 other features that you might use, such as Trending, Marketplace and search. We use the data
  that we have – for example, about the connections you make, the choices and settings you select,
   and what you share and do on and off our Products – to personalise your experience.<br><br><br>
<u>Connect you with people and organisations that you care about:</u>
We help you find and connect with people, groups, businesses, organisations and others that
 matter to you across the Facebook Products that you use. We use the data that we have to make 
 suggestions for you and others – for example, groups to join, events to attend, Pages to follow 
 or send a message to, shows to watch and people who you may want to become friends with.
  Stronger ties make for better communities, and we believe that our services are most useful 
  when people are connected to people, groups and organisations that they care about.<br><br><br>
<u>Empower you to express yourself and communicate about what matters to you:</u>
There are many ways to express yourself on Facebook and to communicate with friends, family
 and others about what matters to you – for example, sharing status updates, photos, videos
  and stories across the Facebook Products that you use, sending messages to a friend or 
  several people, creating events or groups, or adding content to your profile. We have also
   developed, and continue to explore, new ways for people to use technology, such as augmented
    reality and 360 video to create and share more expressive and engaging content on Facebook.
    <br><br><br> <u>Help you discover content, products and services that may interest you:</u>
We show you ads, offers and other sponsored content to help you discover content, products and
 services that are offered by the many businesses and organisations that use Facebook and other
  Facebook Products. Section 2 below explains this in more detail.<br><br><br>
  <u>Combat harmful conduct, and protect and support our community:</u>
People will only build community on Facebook if they feel safe. We employ dedicated teams around
 the world and develop advanced technical systems to detect misuse of our Products, harmful conduct
  towards others and situations where we may be able to help support or protect our community.
   If we learn of content or conduct like this, we will take appropriate action – for example,
    offering help, removing content, removing or restricting access to certain features, disabling
     an account or contacting law enforcement. We share data with other Facebook Companies
      when we detect misuse or harmful conduct by someone using one of our Products.
      <br><br><br><u>Use and develop advanced technologies to provide safe and functional services for everyone:</u>
We use and develop advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning 
systems and augmented reality so that people can use our Products safely regardless of physical
 ability or geographic location. For example, technology such as this helps people who have 
 visual impairments understand what or who is in photos or videos shared on Facebook or Instagram.
  We also build sophisticated network and communication technology to help more people connect to
   the Internet in areas with limited access. And we develop automated systems to improve our 
   ability to detect and remove abusive and dangerous activity that may harm our community and 
   the integrity of our Products.<br><br><br>
   <u>Research ways to make our services better:</u>
We engage in research to develop, test and improve our Products. This includes analysing the 
data we have about our users and understanding how people use our Products, for example by 
conducting surveys and testing and troubleshooting new features. Our Data Policy explains how
 we use data to support this research for the purposes of developing and improving our services.<br><br><br>
 <u>Provide consistent and seamless experiences across the Facebook Company Products:</u>
Our Products help you find and connect with people, groups, businesses, organisations and others
 that are important to you. We design our systems so that your experience is consistent and 
 seamless across the different Facebook Company Products that you use. For example, we use data
  about the people you engage with on Facebook to make it easier for you to connect with them 
  on Instagram or Messenger, and we enable you to communicate with businesses that you follow 
  on Facebook through Messenger.<br><br><br>
  <u>Enable global access to our services:</u>
To operate our global service, we need to store and distribute content and data in our data 
centres and systems around the world, including outside your country of residence. This 
infrastructure may be operated or controlled by Facebook, Inc., Facebook Ireland Limited 
or its affiliates.
