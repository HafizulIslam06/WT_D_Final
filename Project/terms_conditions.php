    <h1><u>Terms & Conditions</u></h1>    
     <h3 id="h3">Welcome to E-Cell! <br><br>

Facebook builds technologies and services that enable people to connect with each other,
build communities and grow businesses. These Terms govern your use of Facebook, Messenger
 and the other products, features, apps, services, technologies and software that we offer
  (the Facebook Products or Products), except where we expressly state that separate terms
   (and not these) apply. These Products are provided to you by Facebook, Inc.

We don't charge you to use Facebook or the other products and services covered by these Terms.
 Instead, businesses and organisations pay us to show you ads for their products and services.
  By using our Products, you agree that we can show you ads that we think will be relevant to
   you and your interests. We use your personal data to help determine which ads to show you.

We don't sell your personal data to advertisers, and we don't share information that directly
 identifies you (such as your name, email address or other contact information) with advertisers
  unless you give us specific permission. Instead, advertisers can tell us things such as the
   kind of audience that they want to see their ads, and we show those ads to people who may
    be interested. We provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads that 
    help them understand how people are interacting with their content. See Section 2 below to
     learn more.

Our Data Policy explains how we collect and use your personal data to determine some of the ads
 that you see and provide all of the other services described below. You can also go to your 
 settings at any time to review the privacy choices that you have about how we use your data.
