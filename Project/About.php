        Our passion for delighting customers drives us to constantly invent on
        their behalf. Working backward from customer needs, we’re constantly
        seeking to improve our services, add benefits and features, and invent
        new products. <br/>With this in mind, over the years we’ve launched
        innovative services such as Prime, Alexa and our family of Echo devices,
        award-winning entertainment, and exclusive E-CELL products.

    E-CELL is rolling out on-site COVID-19 vaccination events for front-line
    employees, starting in Missouri, Nevada, and Kansas. Throughout the COVID-19
    pandemic, the health and safety of our employees, partners, and customers
    has<br />
    been our top priority. We built a COVID-19 testing program from scratch when
    the pandemic began, to ensure front-line employees had access to free, regular
    testing—something that wasn’t available in most of their communities. We<br />
    continue to expand the voluntary testing program, and we’ve already processed
    millions of tests across more than 800 sites globally. Now, we’re using what
    we learned from the on-site testing program to bring COVID-19 vaccines to
    our<br />
    front-line employees. Over the coming weeks, in partnership with local
    government and public health officials, we are beginning to host on-site
    vaccination events administered by licensed health care providers at an<br />
    initial set of E-CELL operations buildings in the United States. We’re
    starting at some fulfillment centers in Missouri, Nevada, and Kansas, but will
    expand the program across the country as more vaccines become available to<br />
    front-line employees in other states. This is an important initiative not only
    for the health and safety of E-CELL employees, but for the communities where
    our teams live and work. Our events will protect E-CELL employees while
    also<br />
    helping ease the burden on community-run vaccination clinics. E-CELL is
    working hard to access COVID-19 vaccine supplies for all of our employees at
    the earliest appropriate time. And because not every employee will have
    access<br />
    to on-site clinics right away, we are offering up to $80 to front-line
    employees who get vaccinated off-site. This benefit is on top of the $2.5
    billion we invested in special bonuses and incentives for our teams
    worldwide<br />
    over the last year, and the $11.5 billion we invested in COVID-19-related
    measures overall. Employees working in E-CELL fulfillment centers, AWS data
    centers, and Whole Foods Market stores in the U.S. have been helping
    customers<br />
    stay safe and receive vital products and services at home. The services are
    especially critical for people with underlying medical conditions and those
    susceptible to complications from COVID-19. We are proud our employees have<br />
    helped customers stay safe, and we’ll continue investing in processes and
    changes to protect our employees and communities around the world. Read more
